# Scope

As per the challenge requirements I'll here briefly describe high level design choices, scope, tradeoffs and edgecases.

I'll be aiming to implement the 5th level of the challenge.

From a high level perspective I'll be implementing the following components:

- A service/daemon that implements an async gRPC server with authentication and authorization. From here on reffered to as "rrockerd"
- A worker library that can start/stop/qeuery/stream fully isolated tasks with resource control. This will be a module of rrockerd as it's specialized enough that it's unlikely to be useful as a standalone library.
- A simple CLI with commands to start/stop/query/stream tasks using the rrocker daemon. From here on reffered to as "rrocker-cli"
- A shared gRPC api that will be a standalone library that's easy to consume from both rrockerd and rrocker-cli. From here on referred to as "rrocker-lib"

Breaking each component further down here's a not necessarily exhaustive list of corners I'll cut:

## rrockerd:
I'll be using the rust crate [nix](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix) extensively for the low level systemcalls. Since nix is merely a safe wrapper around libc I believe this is in the spirit of the challenge.

The daemon will be run entirely in memory and will not persist any state in order to survive reboots/crashes.

The gRPC API is assumed to be internal only, as such there won't be any rate limiting, user action logging or abuse mitigations.

Dealing with tty, ptty, terminals and what not is entirely out of scope and as such any program output will be streamed as the raw bytes written to the stdout and stderr pipes.
Furthermore the output will be chunked on newlines and any lines longer than max gRPC packet size will be truncated.

Isolation will be hardcoded to fully isolate each scheduled task from other tasks and the host system. That means a seperate PID, Mount, User and Network namespace for each task with no way to connect them.
There'll be no network devices attached to any tasks.

Mounting is also considered out of scope and as such each task will be chrooted to a RW root that's a copy of a base image that's removed upon exit of the task.

I'll make no attempt at Linux backwards compatability and the minimum kernel version will be 5.0+.

Tasks will inherit the UID/GID of the daemon and internally be mapped as root.

For the gRPC implementation I'll be using the rust crate [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) to avoid reinventing the wheel.

## rrocker-cli:
The CLI will need to be run once per command, so scheduling multiple tasks requires multiple invocations.

There'll be zero command line switches and as such it'll be hardcoded to connect to rrockerd running on localhost.

## rrocker-lib:
No attention will be paid to backwards compatability of the API, meaning no versioning or abstractions.

Human friendliness of the API is a distant afterthought, as such full UUIDs will be required to interact with tasks.

# Security
I'll briefly discuss my authentication and authorization scheme below.

## Authentication
Authentication will be done with mTLS as per the challenge rules.

As per best practice I'll be generating the following certs:
- Root Certificate Authority (CA). This is our root of trust and should be stored on an airgapped system that's only used to sign/revoke the server/client CAs.
- Seperate server and client CAs. These are used to sign/revoke server and client certs. Furthermore they're seperated such that an infrastructure team is able to own their CA and deploy new servers independently. These CAs also introduce an indirection such that servers and clients don't need to know about all clients and servers but can simply verify an identity has been signed by the server/client CA.
- Server_1 Certificate. Cert used by the server to auth with the clients
- Client_1 and Client_2 certs used to demo user's only being able to see their own tasks
- Admin_1 Certificate cert used to demo admin's being able to see all tasks
- An untrusted CA + client cert to demo unauthorized client's can't connect

Private keys will be generated with OpenSSL using the prime256v1 ECDH curve.

## Authorization
The authorization scheme will be super simple solution where an authenticated user either is an admin or regular user.
A regular user will only be able to perform actions on it's own tasks while an admin can interact with **all** tasks.

This distinction will be done by looking at the Common Name of the client certificate, `CN=client` for clients and `CN=admin` for admins.
The public key of a cert will be used as the client id despite the drawback that a single client would have to share the same cert across multiple servers against best practices. 
In a production environment you'd introduce another indirection such a user could have multiple certs all manage the same tasks and possibly some way to further segment these tasks into groups.

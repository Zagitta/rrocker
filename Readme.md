# Rusty Remote Docker
A rust implementation of [Teleport's system worker coding challenge](https://github.com/gravitational/careers).

Do us both a favour and **never** use this in production ðŸ˜…

## Overview
This implementation is split into 3 crates:
- rrockerd: The server/daemon that implements the work scheduler and gRPC service.
- rrocker-init: The init system that sets up the namespaces and launches the task
- rrocker-cli: The CLI client that uses the gRPC API to request work to be scheduled by the server.
- rrocker-lib: The shared API between the client and daemon.



## Approach
The initial document describing the design/approach can be found [here](Approach.md)

## Example
Here's a short and sweet demo of how to run this code:

```
> cargo build
> sudo ./target/debug/rrockerd 2&1> /dev/null
> ./target/debug/rrocker-cli output $(./target/debug/rrocker-cli run echo "hello world")
hello world
(process terminated with code 0)
